        <p>
          Hi! I'm Luna Araújo, a designer and developer passionate about creating engaging interactive experiences.
          I specialize in game development and have worked on various projects ranging from casual mobile games 
          to complex video bingo systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I work at Caleta Gaming where I contribute to the design and development of video bingo 
          and casino games. My work focuses on creating visually appealing and mechanically engaging gaming 
          experiences that keep players entertained.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Career</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--muted)]">
        <p>
          My journey in game development started with independent projects and game jams, where I honed my 
          skills in Unity and game design. I've developed several games including platformers and adventure 
          titles that have been played by thousands of people worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Caleta Gaming, I've been involved in the development of multiple successful titles including 
          Zen Tiger Bingo and Sugar Bingo, contributing to both the visual design and gameplay mechanics 
          that make these games stand out in the market.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--muted)]">
        <p>
          When I'm not working on games, I enjoy exploring new game mechanics, participating in game jams, 
          and experimenting with different art styles. I'm particularly interested in pixel art and creating 
          vibrant, colorful game worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love playing indie games, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up to date with 
          the latest trends in game design and development.
